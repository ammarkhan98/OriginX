## ⏱️ Next 30 Minutes: Do This NOW

### Step 1: Open the Right Files (5 minutes)

Open these in your code editor:
```
1. 00_START_HERE.md         ← Read this first
2. ARCHITECTURE.md          ← Deep dive into design
3. DEVELOPER_LEARNING_PATH.md  ← Your complete roadmap
4. DAILY_CHECKLIST.md       ← Print this!
5. backend/cpp/include/vpn_engine.h  ← Study this code
```

### Step 2: Read 00_START_HERE.md (5 minutes)

Quick orientation to the project.

### Step 3: Skim ARCHITECTURE.md (10 minutes)

Just get the overview. Don't memorize details.

Key sections to focus on:
- Project Structure
- Architecture Layers
- IPC Protocol

### Step 4: Bookmark DEVELOPER_LEARNING_PATH.md (5 minutes)

This is your bible for the next 10 weeks. 
Print it or keep it open constantly.

### Step 5: Print DAILY_CHECKLIST.md (5 minutes)

This keeps you on track day-by-day.

## 🆘 If You Get Stuck

### Can't understand architecture?
→ Read it again slower  
→ Watch YouTube architecture videos  
→ Ask ChatGPT to explain it differently  

### Can't find a file?
→ Use: `find . -name "filename"`  
→ Or search in VS Code (Cmd+P)  

### Don't know what a term means?
→ Google it  
→ Ask ChatGPT  
→ Check the glossary (create one!)  

### Feeling overwhelmed?
→ That's NORMAL for week 1  
→ Just focus on understanding  
→ Don't worry about implementation yet
